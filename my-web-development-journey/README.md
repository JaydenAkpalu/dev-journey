## The CSS Grid layout - 19/04/2025
#### Learned the fundamentals of CSS Grid, a powerful tool for creating flexible and responsive web layouts. It enabled me to design grid-based structures with ease.
#### Key Concepts I Learned:
#### 1. Defining Grids: I learned how to set up grid containers using display: grid and define the number of columns and rows with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows. This gives me full control over the structure of the layout.
#### 2. Column Gap: I explored the column-gap property to control the spacing between columns in the grid. This helps create more breathing room between elements, improving readability and visual flow.
#### 3. Row Gap: I also learned about the row-gap property, which allows me to control the spacing between rows. This ensures consistent spacing vertically between grid items.
#### These concepts helped me create more organized and responsive layouts with minimal effort, while also improving the overall design flexibility across different screen sizes
