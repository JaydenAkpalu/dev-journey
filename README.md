# MY WEB DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY - ZERO TO HERO
##### Welcome to the log of my web development learning journey! I started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript in December 2024 at the Nexgen Educational Hub in Ghana, and also utilized YouTube tutorials and courses on freecodecamp.
##### This folder contain notes and everything I learn in web development, from basic HTML & CSS to JavaScript, responsive design, and beyond.


## The div element - 15/04/2025
#### Learned and practised how to use the div element and display block, inline block, and flex
#### Also learned and practised how to create and customize buttons. Tried recreating the tweet button
#### Practised hover animation and also transitions
#### Practised the box-shadow feature


## The nested layout - 17/04/2025
#### Learned how to structure websites using the nested layout technique
#### Utilised the nested layout technique to create a well structured facebook friends suggestion page clone
#### Used Google drawings to draw and visualize the outline and structure of various websites, including the vertical and horizontal layouts, and also converted the designs to functional, well structured codes.


## The CSS Grid layout - 19/04/2025
#### Learned the fundamentals of CSS Grid, a powerful tool for creating web layouts. It enabled me to design grid-based structures with ease.
#### Key Concepts I Learned:
#### 1. Defining Grids: I learned how to set up grid containers using display: grid and define the number of columns and rows with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows. This gives me full control over the structure of the layout.
#### 2. Column Gap: I explored the column-gap property to control the spacing between columns in the grid. This helps create more breathing room between elements, improving readability and visual flow.
#### 3. Row Gap: I also learned about the row-gap property, which allows me to control the spacing between rows. This ensures consistent spacing vertically between grid items.
#### These concepts helped me create more organized and responsive layouts with minimal effort, while also improving the overall design flexibility across different screen sizes.


## The CSS Flexbox Property - 26/04/2025
#### Learned how to use the flexbox for creating flexible web layouts in contrasst to the rigid grid layout.
#### Key Concepts I learned:
#### 1. Defining flexbox: I learned how to set up flexbox usign display:flex as well as specifying the direction of the flexbox using flex-direction, which can be set to either row or column
#### 2. Aligning items: I learned how to align items in a div along the x-axis and y-axis. For the x-axis, I used the justify-content property, which can be set to values like center, start, space-around, space-between, and end. For the y-axis, I used the align-items property, which can also be set to values like center, start, end, and stretch.


## The CSS Nested Flexbox - 15/05/2025
#### Learned how to create more complex and responsive layouts by nesting flex containers within each other .Practised combining parent and child flex containers to build multi-section layouts with both horizontal and vertical alignment.
#### Key Concepts I Learned:
#### 1. Nesting Flex Containers: I created flex containers inside other flex containers to design more structured layouts.
#### 2. Independent Axis Control: Each nested flex container can have its own flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items properties, allowing precise control of both axes within sections.
#### 3. flex: 1: I learned how flex: 1 allows a flex item to grow and take up the remaining space inside the flex container proportionally. It’s a shorthand for flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0.
#### 4. flex-shrink: This property controls how items shrink when there’s not enough space. I experimented with setting different flex-shrink values to prioritize which items reduce in size first.
